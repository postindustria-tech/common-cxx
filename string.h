/**
 * @ingroup FiftyOneDegreesCommon
 * @defgroup FiftyOneDegreesString String
 *
 * String structures containing the string and length.
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * The String structure allows a string and its length to be stored in one
 * structure. This avoids unnecessary calls to strlen. Both the string and its
 * length are allocated in a single operation, so the size of the actual
 * structure (when including the string terminator) is
 * sizeof(#fiftyoneDegreesString) + length. This means that the string itself
 * starts at "value" and continues into the rest of the allocated memory.
 *
 * ## Get
 *
 * Getting a const char * from a #fiftyoneDegreesString structure can be done
 * by casting a reference to the "value" field:
 * ```
 * (const char*)&string->value
 * ```
 * However, this can be simplified by using the #FIFTYONE_DEGREES_STRING macro
 * which also performs a NULL check on the structure to avoid a segmentation
 * fault.
 *
 * ## Compare
 *
 * This file contains two case insensitive string comparison methods as
 * standards like `stricmp` vary across compilers.
 *
 * **fiftyoneDegreesStringCompare** : compares two strings case insensitively
 *
 * **fiftyoneDegreesStringCompareLength** : compares two strings case
 * insensitively up to the length required. Any characters after this point are
 * ignored
