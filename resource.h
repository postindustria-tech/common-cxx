 *
 * Resources to be managed by a resource manager.
 *
 * ## Terms
 * 
 * **Resource** : a pointer to anything which needs to be replaced or freed in
 * a thread-safe manor
 *
 * **Manager** : manages access to a resource by handing out handles and
 * altering the resource safely
 *
 * **Handle** : a reference to a resource which is being managed. This is the
 * only way in which a resource should be accessed
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * A Resource is a structure which can be changed or freed at any time, so
 * is managed by a resource manager to allow safe concurrent access. Any
 * resource which is being used will not be changed or freed until the last
 * reference to it has been released.
 *
 * ## Create
 *
 * A resource manager is created by allocating the memory for the structure and
 * calling the #fiftyoneDegreesResourceManagerInit method to give it a resource
 * to manage, and a method to free it when necessary.
 *
 * ## Get
 *
 * A handle to a resource can be fetched from a resource manager using the
 * #fiftyoneDegreesResourceHandleIncUse method. This increments the "in use"
 * counter in a thread safe manor and returns an exclusive handle to the
 * resource.
 *
 * When getting a handle to a resource, if all the available handles are in use
 * then the method will block until one is available.
 *
 * ## Release
 *
 * Once a resource handle is finished with, it must be released back to the
 * resource manager using the #fiftyoneDegreesResourceHandleDecUse method. This
 * releases the handle so it is available to other threads.
 *
 * ## Free
 *
 * A resource manager is freed, along with its resource, using the
 * #fiftyoneDegreesResourceManagerFree method. This prevents any new handles
 * from being acquired, and frees the resource being managed.
 * If the resource has active handles, then a free method does not block.
 * Instead it prevents new handles from being acquired and sets the manager
 * to free the resource once the last handle has been released.
 *
 *
 * ## Replace
 *
 * A resource can be replaced using the #fiftyoneDegreesResourceReplace method.
 * This swaps the resource being managed so that any new requests for a handle
 * return the new resource. The existing resource is freed once the last active
 * handle to it has been released.
 *
 * ## Usage Example
 *
 * ```
 * typedef struct someResourceType {
 *     fiftyoneDegreesResourceHandle *handle; 
 *     void *data;
 * }
 * someResourceType *resource;
 * fiftyoneDegreesResourceManager manager;
 *
 * // Initialise the resource manager with a resource
 * fiftyoneDegreesResourceManagerInit(
 *     &manager,
 *     resource,
 *     &resource->handle,
 *     Free);
 *
 * // Check that the resource handle was set successfully
 * if (resource->handle != NULL) {
 *
 *     // Get a handle to the resource to ensure it is not freed by any
 *     // other threads
 *     someResourceType *localResource = (someResourceType*)
 *         fiftyoneDegreesResourceHandleIncUse(&manager)->resource;
 *
 *     // Free the resource. This operation will be postponed until there are
 *     // no remaining handled being used
 *     fiftyoneDegreesResourceManagerFree(&manager);
 *
 *     // Do something with the resource while it is guaranteed to be available
 *     // ...
 *
 *     // Release the resource so other threads know it is eligible for freeing
 *     fiftyoneDegreesResourceHandleDecUse(resource->handle);
 *
 *     // This is the point where the call to free the manager will actually
 *     // be carried out now that nothing is referencing the resource
 * }
 * ```
